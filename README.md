This is my final project for Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course. I wanted to do something that used AI, and I was interested in making a personal planner, because it's something I would use. 
The AI Planner was built for the planning of complex, medium or long-term goals (e.g. a few months), but can also be used for shorter goals or as a regular planner. By providing information such as the objective of the plan, the deadline and the number of hours that the user plans to dedicate weekly to this objective, the application creates a personalized plan with tasks to be performed to achieve the main goal. The tasks are divided into groups and can be edited to further customize the plan.

The todo app contains the Task model and the funcionalities for create, view, update and delete the tasks. It also uses the built in User model and the ModelForm forms to handle the authentication proccess with the register, login and logout views.

The goals app has the Plan model and allows the creation and visualization of the plans. The utils file contains the function that handles assembling the prompt with the variables passed by the user and uses the api to return the response generated by the AI. The create_plan view then uses this information to create the plan.
